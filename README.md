# ansible-lxc-host-env

Simply clone and `vagrant up` and you will have yourself two shiny new hosts, both running Ubuntu Trusty 64, one running an lxc container ~~complete with ruby on rails and rvm~~ to manage ruby versions;  the other running postgresql dbms.

This is all provisioned with Ansible and Vagrant.

Have fun.
